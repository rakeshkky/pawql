### Question 1

**Question**: How many active dogs are currently registered in the system?

‚úÖ **PromptQL Response**:

#### Assistant Action 1

I'll help you find the number of active dogs currently registered in the system.

**Plan:**
1. Query the dogs table to count dogs where:
   - status is 'ACTIVE' (assuming this is how active dogs are marked)
   - registration_date is not null (to ensure they are properly registered)
2. Store the results in an artifact for display

**Generated Code:**
```sql
sql = """
SELECT 
    COUNT(1) as active_dog_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT owner_id) as unique_owner_count
FROM app.learn_pql_public_dogs
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'
"""

results = executor.run_sql(sql)

executor.store_artifact(
    identifier='active_dogs_summary',
    title='Active Dogs Summary',
    artifact_type='table',
    data=[{
        'Metric': 'Number of Active Dogs',
        'Value': results[0]['active_dog_count']
    },
    {
        'Metric': 'Number of Unique Owners',
        'Value': results[0]['unique_owner_count']
    }]
)
```

**Code Output:**
```
SQL statement returned 1 rows. Sample rows: [{'active_dog_count': 31094, 'unique_owner_count': 12544}]
Stored table artifact: identifier = 'active_dogs_summary', title = 'Active Dogs Summary', number of rows = 2, sample rows preview = [{'Metric': 'Number of Active Dogs', 'Value': 31094}, {'Metric': 'Number of Unique Owners', 'Value': 12544}]

```

#### Assistant Action 2

Here are the current statistics for active dogs in the system:
<artifact identifier='active_dogs_summary' />

This shows we have 31,094 active dogs registered, owned by 12,544 unique owners. On average, this means each owner has approximately 2.5 dogs registered in the system.

#### Artifacts

<details>
<summary><strong>Artifact: active_dogs_summary</strong> (table)</summary>

**Title:** Active Dogs Summary

```json
[{'Metric': 'Number of Active Dogs', 'Value': 31094}, {'Metric': 'Number of Unique Owners', 'Value': 12544}]
```

</details>



### üîç Evaluation

**Score (0-10)**: 8

**Notes**: Core query and count (31094) match expected. Added complexity with owner count and averages wasn't required but provides useful context. Table name differs slightly (app.learn_pql_public_dogs vs dogs). Registration date check mentioned in plan but not used in query.

### Question 2

**Question**: What are the names and locations of all active PawQL locations?

‚úÖ **PromptQL Response**:

#### Assistant Action 1

I'll query the locations table to get this information, focusing on active locations.

**Plan:**
1. Query the locations table to get:
   - Location name
   - Full address (address, city, state, zip)
   - Status
2. Filter for active locations (assuming status = 'ACTIVE')
3. Order by location name for easy reading
4. Store results in an artifact

**Generated Code:**
```sql
sql = """
SELECT 
    location_name,
    address,
    city,
    state,
    zip_code,
    status
FROM app.learn_pql_public_locations
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'
ORDER BY location_name
"""

locations = executor.run_sql(sql)

if len(locations) == 0:
    executor.print("No active locations found")
else:
    # Format the addresses nicely for display
    formatted_locations = []
    for loc in locations:
        formatted_locations.append({
            'Location Name': loc['location_name'],
            'Address': f"{loc['address']}, {loc['city']}, {loc['state']} {loc['zip_code']}"
        })
    
    executor.store_artifact(
        'active_locations',
        'Active PawQL Locations',
        'table',
        formatted_locations
    )
```

**Code Output:**
```
SQL statement returned 8 rows. Sample rows: [{'location_name': 'Beverly Hills Bark Club', 'address': '247 Hermiston Motorway', 'city': 'Beverly Hills', 'state': 'CA', 'zip_code': '93859', 'status': 'ACTIVE'}, {'location_name': 'Downtown Doggy Paradise', 'address': '35392 E South Street', 'city': 'San Francisco', 'state': 'CA', 'zip_code': '94123', 'status': 'ACTIVE'}]
Stored table artifact: identifier = 'active_locations', title = 'Active PawQL Locations', number of rows = 8, sample rows preview = [{'Location Name': 'Beverly Hills Bark Club', 'Address': '247 Hermiston Motorway, Beverly Hills, CA 93859'}, {'Location Name': 'Downtown Doggy Paradise', 'Address': '35392 E South Street, San Francisco, CA 94123'}]

```

#### Assistant Action 2

Here are all the active PawQL locations:
<artifact identifier='active_locations' warning='I cannot see the full data so I must not make up observations' />

#### Artifacts

<details>
<summary><strong>Artifact: active_locations</strong> (table)</summary>

**Title:** Active PawQL Locations

```json
[{'Location Name': 'Beverly Hills Bark Club', 'Address': '247 Hermiston Motorway, Beverly Hills, CA 93859'}, {'Location Name': 'Downtown Doggy Paradise', 'Address': '35392 E South Street, San Francisco, CA 94123'}, {'Location Name': 'Fresno Family Dog Park', 'Address': '8591 Lehner Street, Fresno, CA 93611'}, {'Location Name': 'Oakland Community Canines', 'Address': '18089 Arne Greens, Oakland, CA 94501'}, {'Location Name': 'Sacramento Suburban Paws', 'Address': '735 Sydni Falls, Sacramento, CA 65163'}, {'Location Name': 'San Diego Seaside Dogs', 'Address': '7237 Donnelly Brooks, San Diego, CA 91911'}, {'Location Name': 'Santa Monica Surf Dogs', 'Address': '316 5th Avenue, Santa Monica, CA 94010'}, {'Location Name': 'Silicon Valley Paws', 'Address': '1341 N Harrison Street, Palo Alto, CA 94020'}]
```

</details>



### üîç Evaluation

**Score (0-10)**: 8

**Notes**: Query correctly filters active locations and returns expected data. Includes extra fields (address, zip) and more complex formatting than needed. Core SQL logic matches expected approach but is more verbose than necessary.
