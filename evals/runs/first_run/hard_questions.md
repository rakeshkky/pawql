### Question 1

**Question**: Identify the top 3 dog breeds that have the highest incident rates at premium locations, and provide their incident rate per visit along with the total number of park visits for each breed.

‚úÖ **PromptQL Response**:

#### Assistant Action 1

I'll help you analyze the incident rates by dog breed at premium locations. Let me break this down into steps.

**Plan:**
1. First, we need to identify premium locations
   - We'll consider locations with higher park capacity and more amenities (grooming stations, boarding kennels) as premium
   - We'll use a scoring system based on these facilities

2. Then, we'll:
   - Join park visits with incident reports to get incident data
   - Join with dogs table to get breed information
   - Calculate total visits and incidents by breed at premium locations
   - Calculate incident rate (incidents/visits)
   - Sort by incident rate and get top 3 breeds

Assumptions:
- A location is considered premium if it has above average facilities (park capacity, grooming stations, and boarding kennels)
- We'll only consider breeds with at least 10 visits to avoid statistical anomalies
- We'll only count incidents that occurred during park visits (matching visit_date and incident_date)

**Generated Code:**
```sql
# First identify premium locations based on facilities
sql = """
WITH location_scores AS (
    SELECT 
        location_id,
        park_capacity + grooming_stations + boarding_kennels as facility_score,
        AVG(park_capacity + grooming_stations + boarding_kennels) OVER () as avg_score
    FROM app.learn_pql_public_locations
    WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'
),
premium_locations AS (
    SELECT location_id 
    FROM location_scores 
    WHERE facility_score > avg_score
),
visit_incidents AS (
    SELECT 
        d.breed,
        COUNT(DISTINCT pv.visit_id) as total_visits,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ir.report_id IS NOT NULL THEN ir.report_id END) as total_incidents
    FROM app.learn_pql_public_park_visits pv
    JOIN app.learn_pql_public_dogs d ON pv.dog_id = d.dog_id
    JOIN premium_locations pl ON pv.location_id = pl.location_id
    LEFT JOIN app.learn_pql_public_incident_reports ir 
        ON pv.dog_id = ir.dog_id 
        AND pv.visit_date = ir.incident_date
        AND pv.location_id = ir.location_id
    WHERE d.breed IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY d.breed
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT pv.visit_id) >= 10
)
SELECT 
    breed,
    total_visits,
    total_incidents,
    CAST(total_incidents AS FLOAT) / total_visits as incident_rate
FROM visit_incidents
ORDER BY incident_rate DESC
LIMIT 3

**Code Output:**
```
SQL statement returned 3 rows. Sample rows: [{'breed': 'Bulldog', 'total_visits': 2654, 'total_incidents': 0, 'incident_rate': 0.0}, {'breed': 'Labrador Retriever', 'total_visits': 2744, 'total_incidents': 0, 'incident_rate': 0.0}]

```

#### Assistant Action 2

Based on the analysis of premium locations (those with above-average facilities), here are the breeds with the highest incident rates:

<artifact identifier='top_incident_breeds' />

Interestingly, the data shows that there are no recorded incidents for these breeds at premium locations, despite having a significant number of visits. This suggests that premium locations might be doing an excellent job at preventing incidents, possibly through better staffing, facilities, or safety protocols.

Would you like me to:
1. Analyze incident rates across all locations (not just premium) to see if there's a difference?
2. Look into what makes these premium locations successful at preventing incidents?
3. Examine other safety metrics for these breeds?

### üîç Evaluation

**Score (0-10)**: 6

**Notes**: Approach differs significantly from expected analysis. Uses facility scoring instead of square footage for premium locations. Joins are overly restrictive by requiring same-day incidents. Results show 0 incidents which contradicts expected Chihuahua insight. Missing proper rate calculation per 100 visits. Good structure with CTEs but core logic needs adjustment.

### Question 2

**Question**: What are our most profitable appointment time slots, and how much more revenue do we generate during peak hours compared to off-peak times?

‚úÖ **PromptQL Response**:

#### Assistant Action 1

I'll help analyze the appointment revenue patterns across different time slots. Let me break this down into steps.

**Plan:**
1. First, analyze appointments and payments data to:
   - Extract hour of day from appointment times
   - Calculate total revenue per hour
   - Count number of appointments per hour
   - Calculate average revenue per appointment per hour
2. Identify peak vs off-peak hours based on appointment volume
3. Compare revenue metrics between peak and off-peak periods
4. Create summary artifacts showing:
   - Hourly revenue breakdown
   - Peak vs off-peak comparison

Assumptions:
- Using appointment_datetime for time slot analysis
- Defining peak hours based on top 1/3 of hours by appointment volume
- Only considering appointments with associated payments
- All times are stored in the same timezone as the system

**Generated Code:**
```sql

#### Assistant Action 2

I notice we didn't get any results from the queries. Let me check if there's any data in the appointments and payments tables, and adjust the query if needed.

**Plan:**
1. First, check if we have any data in the appointments and payments tables
2. Check what status values exist in these tables
3. Modify the analysis based on what we find

**Generated Code:**
```sql

    COUNT(1) as total_appointments,
    COUNT(DISTINCT status) as unique_statuses

executor.run_sql(sql)

# Check what status values exist
sql = """
SELECT DISTINCT status 
FROM app.learn_pql_public_appointments 
WHERE status IS NOT NULL
"""
executor.run_sql(sql)

# Check payments data
sql = """
SELECT 
    COUNT(1) as total_payments,
    COUNT(DISTINCT status) as unique_statuses

**Code Output:**
```
SQL statement returned 1 rows. Sample rows: [{'total_appointments': 180028, 'unique_statuses': 3}]
SQL statement returned 3 rows. Sample rows: [{'status': 'CANCELLED'}, {'status': 'NO_SHOW'}]

SQL statement returned 1 rows. Sample rows: [{'appointments_with_payments': 185000}]

```

**Code Error:**
```
[object Object] could not be cloned.
```

#### Assistant Action 3

I see the data now. Let me adjust the query to account for the actual status values and structure a proper analysis.

**Plan:**
1. Modify the analysis to:
   - Remove the 'completed' status filter since we see different status values
   - Include all non-cancelled, non-no-show appointments
   - Include all successful payments
2. Calculate hourly metrics and identify peak hours
3. Create the same two artifacts but with the corrected data

```

#### Assistant Action 4

Based on the analysis, here are the key findings about our appointment revenue patterns:

Here's the detailed hourly breakdown showing revenue and appointment volumes throughout the day:
<artifact identifier='hourly_revenue_breakdown' />

The comparison between peak and off-peak hours reveals a significant difference:
<artifact identifier='peak_vs_offpeak_comparison' />

Key observations:
1. Peak hours generate significantly more revenue, with:
   - Nearly 3x more appointments (48,910 vs 17,485)
   - Almost 4x more total revenue ($6.87M vs $1.78M)
   - 37% higher average revenue per appointment ($139.57 vs $101.91)

2. This suggests that:
   - Our most profitable time slots are during peak hours
   - We're able to command higher prices during peak hours
   - There's significant untapped potential in off-peak hours, given the lower utilization and revenue per appointment

Would you like to explore any specific aspects of this analysis in more detail, such as which specific hours are most profitable or strategies to improve off-peak revenue?

### üîç Evaluation

**Score (0-10)**: 7

**Notes**: Uses NTILE for peak hours instead of explicit 10AM-2PM golden hours. SQL structure differs from expected with focus on terciles rather than specific time windows. Results show general peak vs off-peak patterns but miss the specific 'golden hour' revenue premium analysis. Core revenue metrics captured but timezone handling missing.
