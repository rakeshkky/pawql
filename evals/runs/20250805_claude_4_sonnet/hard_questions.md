### Question 1

**Question**: Identify the top 3 dog breeds that have the highest incident rates at premium locations, and provide their incident rate per visit along with the total number of park visits for each breed.

✅ **PromptQL Response**:

#### Assistant Action 1

I'll help you identify the top 3 dog breeds with the highest incident rates at premium locations. Let me start by analyzing the data to understand what constitutes "premium locations" and then calculate incident rates per visit for each breed.

**Plan:**
1. First, I need to understand what makes a location "premium" by examining the locations table to see if there are any indicators like higher capacity, more amenities, or specific naming patterns.
2. Get all park visits data joined with dog breed information and location details.
3. Get all incident reports data joined with dog breed information and location details.
4. Filter both datasets to only include premium locations.
5. Calculate the total number of park visits per breed at premium locations.
6. Calculate the total number of incidents per breed at premium locations.
7. Calculate the incident rate per visit for each breed (incidents / visits).
8. Identify the top 3 breeds with the highest incident rates.
9. Store the results in an artifact with breed name, incident rate per visit, total incidents, and total visits.

**Generated Code:**
```sql
# First, let's examine the locations to understand what might constitute "premium" locations
locations_sql = """
SELECT location_id, location_name, city, state, park_capacity, grooming_stations, 
       boarding_kennels, square_footage, status
FROM app.learn_pql_public_locations
WHERE status = 'Active'
ORDER BY park_capacity DESC, grooming_stations DESC, boarding_kennels DESC
"""

locations = executor.run_sql(locations_sql)
executor.print(f"Found {len(locations)} active locations")
executor.print("Sample locations (sorted by capacity):")
for i, loc in enumerate(locations[:5]):
    executor.print(f"  {loc['location_name']}: capacity={loc['park_capacity']}, grooming={loc['grooming_stations']}, boarding={loc['boarding_kennels']}")
```

**Code Output:**
```
SQL statement returned 0 rows. Sample rows: []
Found 0 active locations
Sample locations (sorted by capacity):

```

#### Assistant Action 2

Let me check the locations table more broadly to understand the data structure and what locations are available.

**Plan:**
1. Query all locations without filtering by status to see what data is available.
2. Examine the status values and other fields to understand how to identify premium locations.
3. Once I understand the location structure, proceed with the analysis.

**Generated Code:**
```sql
# Let's examine all locations to understand the data structure
locations_sql = """
SELECT location_id, location_name, city, state, park_capacity, grooming_stations, 
       boarding_kennels, square_footage, status
FROM app.learn_pql_public_locations
ORDER BY park_capacity DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 20
"""

locations = executor.run_sql(locations_sql)
executor.print(f"Found {len(locations)} locations")

if len(locations) > 0:
    executor.print("Sample locations:")
    for i, loc in enumerate(locations[:10]):
        executor.print(f"  {loc['location_name']}: capacity={loc['park_capacity']}, grooming={loc['grooming_stations']}, boarding={loc['boarding_kennels']}, status={loc['status']}")
    
    # Check unique status values
    status_sql = "SELECT DISTINCT status FROM app.learn_pql_public_locations"
    statuses = executor.run_sql(status_sql)
    executor.print(f"Available status values: {[s['status'] for s in statuses]}")
else:
    executor.print("No locations found in the table")
```

**Code Output:**
```
SQL statement returned 8 rows. Sample rows: [{'location_id': 4, 'location_name': 'Santa Monica Surf Dogs', 'city': 'Santa Monica', 'state': 'CA', 'park_capacity': 69, 'grooming_stations': 4, 'boarding_kennels': 40, 'square_footage': 9383, 'status': 'ACTIVE'}, {'location_id': 8, 'location_name': 'San Diego Seaside Dogs', 'city': 'San Diego', 'state': 'CA', 'park_capacity': 54, 'grooming_stations': 8, 'boarding_kennels': 47, 'square_footage': 14052, 'status': 'ACTIVE'}]
Found 8 locations
Sample locations:

  San Diego Seaside Dogs: capacity=54, grooming=8, boarding=47, status=ACTIVE
  Beverly Hills Bark Club: capacity=49, grooming=6, boarding=38, status=ACTIVE
  Silicon Valley Paws: capacity=47, grooming=6, boarding=47, status=ACTIVE
  Downtown Doggy Paradise: capacity=44, grooming=6, boarding=28, status=ACTIVE
  Sacramento Suburban Paws: capacity=32, grooming=2, boarding=13, status=ACTIVE
  Oakland Community Canines: capacity=22, grooming=3, boarding=11, status=ACTIVE
  Fresno Family Dog Park: capacity=22, grooming=4, boarding=6, status=ACTIVE
SQL statement returned 1 rows. Sample rows: [{'status': 'ACTIVE'}]
Available status values: ['ACTIVE']

```

#### Assistant Action 3

Now I can see the locations data. I'll define "premium locations" as those with higher capacity, more amenities, or in premium areas. Let me analyze the incident rates by breed at these premium locations.

**Plan:**
1. Define premium locations as those with park capacity >= 45 (top tier locations) or those with high grooming stations (>=6) as these indicate more premium facilities.
2. Get all park visits joined with dog breed information for premium locations.
3. Get all incident reports joined with dog breed information for premium locations.
4. Calculate total visits per breed at premium locations.
5. Calculate total incidents per breed at premium locations.
6. Calculate incident rate per visit for each breed (incidents / visits).
7. Identify the top 3 breeds with the highest incident rates.
8. Store results showing breed, incident rate, total incidents, and total visits.

**Generated Code:**
```sql
# Define premium locations (high capacity >= 45 OR high grooming stations >= 6)
premium_locations_sql = """
SELECT location_id, location_name, park_capacity, grooming_stations, boarding_kennels
FROM app.learn_pql_public_locations
WHERE park_capacity >= 45 OR grooming_stations >= 6
ORDER BY park_capacity DESC
"""

premium_locations = executor.run_sql(premium_locations_sql)
executor.print(f"Premium locations identified: {len(premium_locations)}")
for loc in premium_locations:
    executor.print(f"  {loc['location_name']}: capacity={loc['park_capacity']}, grooming={loc['grooming_stations']}")

premium_location_ids = [loc['location_id'] for loc in premium_locations]
executor.print(f"Premium location IDs: {premium_location_ids}")
```

**Code Output:**
```
SQL statement returned 5 rows. Sample rows: [{'location_id': 4, 'location_name': 'Santa Monica Surf Dogs', 'park_capacity': 69, 'grooming_stations': 4, 'boarding_kennels': 40}, {'location_id': 8, 'location_name': 'San Diego Seaside Dogs', 'park_capacity': 54, 'grooming_stations': 8, 'boarding_kennels': 47}]

  Silicon Valley Paws: capacity=47, grooming=6
  Downtown Doggy Paradise: capacity=44, grooming=6
Premium location IDs: [4, 8, 3, 2, 1]

```

#### Assistant Action 4

Now let me get the park visits and incident data for these premium locations, joined with dog breed information.

**Plan:**
1. Get all park visits at premium locations joined with dog breed information.
2. Get all incident reports at premium locations joined with dog breed information.
3. Calculate total visits per breed at premium locations.
4. Calculate total incidents per breed at premium locations.
5. Calculate incident rate per visit for each breed.
6. Identify the top 3 breeds with highest incident rates.
7. Store the results in an artifact.

**Generated Code:**
```sql

```

#### Assistant Action 5

Now let me get the incident data for these premium locations by breed.

**Plan:**
1. Get all incident reports at premium locations joined with dog breed information.
2. Combine the visits and incidents data to calculate incident rates.
3. Calculate incident rate per visit for each breed (incidents / visits).
4. Identify the top 3 breeds with the highest incident rates.
5. Store the results in an artifact with breed name, incident rate per visit, total incidents, and total visits.

#### Assistant Action 6

Let me fix the error by redefining the variables and completing the analysis.

**Plan:**
1. Re-run the visits query to get the visits_by_breed data.
2. Use the existing incidents_by_breed data.
3. Calculate incident rates for each breed.
4. Identify the top 3 breeds with highest incident rates.
5. Store the results in an artifact.

```

#### Assistant Action 8

Based on my analysis of the data from premium locations (those with high park capacity ≥45 or high grooming stations ≥6), here are the top 3 dog breeds with the highest incident rates:

<artifact identifier='top_3_incident_breeds_premium_locations' />

**Key Findings:**

1. **German Shepherd** leads with the highest incident rate at 0.0235 incidents per visit (2.35%), having 64 incidents across 2,727 park visits at premium locations.

2. **Rottweiler** comes second with 0.0194 incidents per visit (1.94%), recording 54 incidents out of 2,788 visits.

3. **Chihuahua** rounds out the top 3 with 0.0190 incidents per visit (1.90%), with 51 incidents from 2,684 visits.

The analysis was conducted across 5 premium locations: Santa Monica Surf Dogs, San Diego Seaside Dogs, Beverly Hills Bark Club, Silicon Valley Paws, and Downtown Doggy Paradise. These locations were selected based on their high park capacity (≥45 dogs) or premium amenities (≥6 grooming stations).

Interestingly, while German Shepherds and Rottweilers are larger breeds that might be expected to have higher incident rates, Chihuahuas (a small breed) also made the top 3, suggesting that incident rates aren't solely determined by dog size but may also relate to temperament and behavioral factors.

### 🔍 Evaluation

**Score (0-10)**: 7

**Notes**: Approach is generally sound but differs from expected SQL. Uses Python post-processing instead of pure SQL CTEs. Premium location definition based on capacity/grooming rather than square footage. Results show similar pattern with Chihuahuas in top 3 but different ordering. Could be more efficient with single SQL query rather than multiple queries and Python processing.

#### Assistant Action 2

It looks like there might not be a direct relationship between appointments and payments, or the payment status values might be different. Let me explore the data structure to understand how revenue is tracked.

**Plan:**
1. First, examine the appointments table to see what data is available
2. Check the payments table to understand the payment status values and structure
3. Look at services table to see if there are base prices we can use
4. Try alternative approaches to link appointments with revenue data
5. Analyze appointment patterns by time slot even if we can't get exact revenue initially

#### Assistant Action 3

Great! Now I can see the data structure. The payments table has "COMPLETED" status (not "completed"), and all payments have appointment IDs. Let me analyze the most profitable appointment time slots using the correct status value.

**Plan:**
1. Query appointment data joined with completed payments (status = 'COMPLETED') to get actual revenue by appointment time
2. Extract hour from appointment datetime to analyze time slots
3. Calculate total revenue, appointment count, and average revenue per appointment for each hour
4. Identify peak hours (highest total revenue) and off-peak hours (lowest revenue)
5. Calculate revenue differences and percentage improvements between peak and off-peak times
6. Also analyze by day of week to provide additional insights
7. Store results in artifacts for presentation

**Generated Code:**
```sql
# Get appointment data with completed payment information to analyze profitability by time slot

    a.appointment_id,

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Maximize evening capacity** - Your 6-9 PM slots are your revenue goldmine

4. **Evaluate early morning operations** - The midnight-3 AM slots may not be cost-effective
5. **Weekend focus** - Saturday shows the highest revenue potential

The 39.5% revenue premium during peak hours represents a significant opportunity to optimize your scheduling and pricing strategy.

### 🔍 Evaluation

**Score (0-10)**: 7

**Notes**: Analysis focuses on evening peak hours (6-9pm) rather than expected 'golden hours' (10am-2pm). SQL approach is sound but misses timezone handling and specific golden hour comparison. Results are accurate but don't align with expected business hour analysis. Additional day-of-week analysis provided but not requested in original question.
