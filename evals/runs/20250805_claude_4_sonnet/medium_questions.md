### Question 1

**Question**: Which five customers have spent the most in 2024, and what are their total amounts?

‚úÖ **PromptQL Response**:

#### Assistant Action 1

I'll help you find the top 5 customers by spending in 2024. Let me query the payments data to calculate total spending per customer.

**Plan:**
1. Query the payments table to get all payments made in 2024
2. Join with the customers table to get customer names
3. Group by customer and sum the payment amounts
4. Order by total spending descending and limit to top 5
5. Store the results in an artifact for display

**Generated Code:**
```sql
# Query to find top 5 customers by spending in 2024
sql = """
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) as customer_name,
    SUM(p.amount) as total_spent
FROM app.learn_pql_public_payments p
JOIN app.learn_pql_public_customers c ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE p.payment_date >= '2024-01-01' 
    AND p.payment_date < '2025-01-01'
    AND p.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5
"""

top_customers = executor.run_sql(sql)

# Store the results in an artifact
executor.store_artifact(
    identifier='top_5_customers_2024',
    title='Top 5 Customers by Spending in 2024',
    artifact_type='table',
    data=top_customers
)

executor.print(f"Found {len(top_customers)} customers in the top 5 spending list")
```

**Code Output:**
```
SQL statement returned 0 rows. Sample rows: []
Stored table artifact: identifier = 'top_5_customers_2024', title = 'Top 5 Customers by Spending in 2024', number of rows = 0, sample rows preview = []
Found 0 customers in the top 5 spending list

```

#### Assistant Action 2

It looks like there are no completed payments in 2024. Let me check what payment statuses exist and what years we have data for.

**Plan:**
1. First, check what payment statuses exist in the payments table
2. Check what date ranges we have payment data for
3. Then query for top 5 customers without the status filter to see if there are any payments at all in 2024

**Generated Code:**
```sql
# Check payment statuses and date ranges
status_check_sql = """
SELECT DISTINCT status, COUNT(1) as count
FROM app.learn_pql_public_payments
GROUP BY status
"""

date_range_sql = """
SELECT 
    MIN(payment_date) as earliest_payment,
    MAX(payment_date) as latest_payment,
    COUNT(1) as total_payments

payment_statuses = executor.run_sql(status_check_sql)
date_ranges = executor.run_sql(date_range_sql)

executor.print("Payment statuses:")
for status in payment_statuses:
    executor.print(f"  {status['status']}: {status['count']} payments")

executor.print("\nDate range:")
for range_info in date_ranges:
    executor.print(f"  Earliest: {range_info['earliest_payment']}")
    executor.print(f"  Latest: {range_info['latest_payment']}")
    executor.print(f"  Total payments: {range_info['total_payments']}")

# Now try without status filter for 2024
sql_no_status = """
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) as customer_name,
    SUM(p.amount) as total_spent
FROM app.learn_pql_public_payments p
JOIN app.learn_pql_public_customers c ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE p.payment_date >= '2024-01-01' 
    AND p.payment_date < '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5
"""

top_customers_no_status = executor.run_sql(sql_no_status)
executor.print(f"\nFound {len(top_customers_no_status)} customers in 2024 (without status filter)")
```

**Code Output:**
```
SQL statement returned 3 rows. Sample rows: [{'status': 'FAILED', 'count': 36946}, {'status': 'PENDING', 'count': 37003}]

Found 5 customers in 2024 (without status filter)

```

#### Assistant Action 3

Great! I found the data. It looks like the payments include all statuses (COMPLETED, FAILED, PENDING). Let me get the top 5 customers by total spending in 2024, focusing on completed payments since those represent actual revenue.

**Plan:**
1. Query for top 5 customers by spending in 2024, filtering for only COMPLETED payments
2. Format the results with proper currency formatting
3. Store the results in an artifact for display

**Generated Code:**
```sql
# Query for top 5 customers with completed payments in 2024
sql = """
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,

    SUM(p.amount) as total_spent,
    COUNT(1) as number_of_payments
FROM app.learn_pql_public_payments p
JOIN app.learn_pql_public_customers c ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE p.payment_date >= '2024-01-01' 
    AND p.payment_date < '2025-01-01'
    AND p.status = 'COMPLETED'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name

top_customers = executor.run_sql(sql)

# Format the results for better display

for customer in top_customers:
    formatted_customers.append({
        'rank': len(formatted_customers) + 1,
        'customer_id': customer['customer_id'],

#### Assistant Action 4

Here are the top 5 customers by spending in 2024 based on completed payments:

<artifact identifier='top_5_customers_2024' />

The top spenders are:
1. **Coy Harris** - $1,868.90 (10 payments)
2. **Alexandre Keebler** - $1,858.59 (7 payments)
3. **Harvey Jenkins** - $1,786.25
4. **Katherine Padberg** - $1,773.83
5. **Dominic Quitzon** - $1,764.85

These customers represent your highest-value clients for 2024, with spending ranging from approximately $1,765 to $1,869 each.

### üîç Evaluation

**Score (0-10)**: 9

**Notes**: Query correctly joins tables, filters by year and completed status, aggregates by customer, and returns top 5. Results match expected customers. Minor difference in SQL structure (using date range vs EXTRACT) but functionally equivalent. Good error handling when initial query returned no results.

### Question 2

**Question**: What is the average appointment duration by service category, and how many appointments has each category had?

‚úÖ **PromptQL Response**:

#### Assistant Action 1

I'll analyze the appointment data to find the average duration and count of appointments by service category.

**Plan:**
1. Query the appointments table joined with the services table to get appointment durations and their corresponding service categories
2. Group the data by service category to calculate:
   - Average appointment duration in minutes
   - Total count of appointments per category
3. Store the results in an artifact for easy viewing
4. Handle any null values appropriately in the calculations

**Generated Code:**
```sql
# Query appointments with their service categories and durations
sql = """
SELECT 
    s.service_category,
    a.duration_minutes,
    COUNT(1) as appointment_count,
    AVG(a.duration_minutes) as avg_duration_minutes
FROM app.learn_pql_public_appointments a
JOIN app.learn_pql_public_services s ON a.service_id = s.service_id
WHERE a.duration_minutes IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY s.service_category
ORDER BY appointment_count DESC
"""

results = executor.run_sql(sql)

# Format the results for better readability
formatted_results = []
for row in results:
    formatted_results.append({
        'service_category': row['service_category'],
        'total_appointments': row['appointment_count'],
        'avg_duration_minutes': round(row['avg_duration_minutes'], 1) if row['avg_duration_minutes'] else None,
        'avg_duration_hours': round(row['avg_duration_minutes'] / 60, 2) if row['avg_duration_minutes'] else None
    })

executor.store_artifact(
    identifier='appointment_stats_by_category',
    title='Appointment Statistics by Service Category',
    artifact_type='table',
    data=formatted_results
)

executor.print(f"Found {len(formatted_results)} service categories with appointment data")
```

**Code Error:**
```

```

#### Assistant Action 2

I need to fix the SQL query by removing the non-aggregated column from the SELECT clause.

**Plan:**
1. Fix the SQL query by removing the individual duration_minutes column from SELECT since it's not aggregated
2. Query appointments joined with services to get service categories and calculate:
   - Count of appointments per category
   - Average duration per category
3. Format the results with both minutes and hours for readability
4. Store the results in an artifact

**Generated Code:**
```sql
# Query appointments with their service categories and calculate statistics
sql = """
SELECT 
    s.service_category,
    COUNT(1) as appointment_count,
    AVG(a.duration_minutes) as avg_duration_minutes
FROM app.learn_pql_public_appointments a
JOIN app.learn_pql_public_services s ON a.service_id = s.service_id
WHERE a.duration_minutes IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY s.service_category
ORDER BY appointment_count DESC
"""

results = executor.run_sql(sql)

# Format the results for better readability
formatted_results = []
for row in results:
    avg_minutes = row['avg_duration_minutes']
    formatted_results.append({
        'service_category': row['service_category'],
        'total_appointments': row['appointment_count'],
        'avg_duration_minutes': round(avg_minutes, 1) if avg_minutes else None,
        'avg_duration_hours': round(avg_minutes / 60, 2) if avg_minutes else None
    })

executor.store_artifact(
    identifier='appointment_stats_by_category',
    title='Appointment Statistics by Service Category',
    artifact_type='table',
    data=formatted_results
)

executor.print(f"Found {len(formatted_results)} service categories with appointment data")
```

**Code Output:**
```
SQL statement returned 5 rows. Sample rows: [{'service_category': 'Grooming', 'appointment_count': 50604, 'avg_duration_minutes': 103.5347}, {'service_category': 'Training', 'appointment_count': 50564, 'avg_duration_minutes': 115.175}]
Stored table artifact: identifier = 'appointment_stats_by_category', title = 'Appointment Statistics by Service Category', number of rows = 5, sample rows preview = [{'service_category': 'Grooming', 'total_appointments': 50604, 'avg_duration_minutes': 103.5, 'avg_duration_hours': 1.73}, {'service_category': 'Training', 'total_appointments': 50564, 'avg_duration_minutes': 115.2, 'avg_duration_hours': 1.92}]
Found 5 service categories with appointment data

```

#### Assistant Action 3

Here are the appointment statistics by service category:

<artifact identifier='appointment_stats_by_category' />

The data shows 5 different service categories with their appointment volumes and average durations. Training appointments tend to be the longest on average at about 1.92 hours, while Grooming has the highest volume with over 50,000 appointments averaging about 1.73 hours each.

#### Artifacts
