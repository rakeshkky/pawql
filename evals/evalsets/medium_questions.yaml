  - question: "Which five customers have spent the most in 2024, and what are their total amounts?"
    expected_analysis: |
      Join customers and payments tables, filter by year and payment status, aggregate by customer — returning 5 records (Coy, Alexandre, Harvey, Katherine, Dominic).

      SQL Reference:
      ```sql
      SELECT
          c.first_name,
          c.last_name,
          c.email,
          SUM(p.amount) as total_spent
      FROM customers c
      JOIN payments p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
      WHERE p.status = 'COMPLETED'
          AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM p.payment_date) = 2024
      GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email
      ORDER BY total_spent DESC
      LIMIT 5;
      ```

  - question: "What is the average appointment duration by service category, and how many appointments has each category had?"
    expected_analysis: |
      Join appointments and services tables, group by service category, calculate averages and counts — returning 5 records with logical groupings for services.

      SQL Reference:
      ```sql
      SELECT
          s.service_category,
          AVG(a.duration_minutes) as avg_duration_minutes,
          COUNT(1) as appointment_count
      FROM appointments a
      JOIN app.learn_pql_public_services s ON a.service_id = s.service_id
      GROUP BY s.service_category
      ORDER BY appointment_count DESC;
      ```
